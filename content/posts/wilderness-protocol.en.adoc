= The Wilderness Protocol

The Wilderness Protocol is an initiative to offer stations outside repeater range an opportunity to be heard when it is needed the most!
It was first proposed by William Alsup, N6XMW in 1994:

[quote, William Alsup N6XMW, A Wilderness VHF FM Protocol - QST February 1994]
____
All hand-held transceiver-equipped hikers should monitor the national simplex calling frequency, 146.52 MHz, at 10 AM, 1 PM and 4 PM daily, for five minutes.
Any ham already in range of a repeater won't need the protocol, but he could relay [â€¦] a message from an amateur down in the repeater's "shadow".
____

National simplex frequencies of other VHF/UHF bands were suggested as alternatives.
Hams, with ample power, may also monitor on every hour.
Optionally, hams can also announce their presence, so others have an idea who is around.

In a reminder in the Aug 1995 issue of QST (<<alsup1995, Alsup 1995>>), the times were extended to every three hours from 7 AM to 7 PM.

The latest incarnation on the subject was written by Rick Palm, K1CE in August 2021 (<<palm2021, Palm 2021>>).
This suggests that the subject is still relevant.
But Rick also points out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_locator_beacon[Emergency Locator Beacons] as a valid asset.

So, what about Switzerland?
Our cell phone coverage is exceptionally dense, and you have a signal even in remote mountainous areas.
Yet, there are still some blind spots.
However, I would not place my bet on the Wilderness Protocol.
To my knowledge, the Wilderness Protocol is not known around here.
In addition, if you are in an area without cell phone coverage, you are also most likely to be in a location surrounded by mountains.
VHF does not allow you to reach far, and you would need to climb to higher grounds.
Up there, you will likely also have cell phone coverage again.

If you feel like you need more security, have a look at those locator beacons.
The Garmin inReach being a popular choice here.
You also might want to have a look at the https://www.rega.ch/en/our-missions/sites-and-infrastructure/emergency-radio[Rega Emergency Radio Handheld].
This still is a VHF radio.
However, a network of relays is placed strategically placed throughout Switzerland{e}footnote:[the exception being Valais] and is monitored by professionals 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

You should still bring your handheld, though.
It is our hobby, and we should use every excuse to use our frequency privileges.
Doing so, away from our home shacks, can provide new challenges and new joys.
And while you are at that summit, consider to do that https://hb9sota.ch/en/welcome/[Summits on the Air (SOTA)] activation.
